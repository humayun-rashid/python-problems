"""
Task 5.
Write a program that queries the user for a string containing a DNA sequence, and proceeds
to output the proportions of four nucleotide bases (A, C, G and T) as percentage values. You
can assume that the user enters the sequence in lower case. If the user enters an empty string,
display an error message.
Example run:
Enter sequence: aaaagctgcggta
Proportion of A: 38 percent
Proportion of T: 15 percent
Proportion of C: 15 percent
Proportion of G: 30 percent
Display the numbers either in Integers (and observe that the example has an inevitable rounding
error) or display the numbers with decimals.
